        <h1>A little presentation</h1>


        <p></p>Hello! I am giovanni miceli, a 24-year-old master's student in mechanical engineering. I am glad I chose this path because I have always been curious about how things work but also because over the years I have realized how challenging team working is.</p>

        <h2>Curricular projects and lab reports</h2>

        <p><strong>Internal combustion engines reports/strong>: Reports focused on analysis of internal combustion engines, specifically on:  analysis of NEDC and WLTP cycle with computation of CO2 and NOX emission, design of a flywheel, Heat Release Rate and correlation among spark advance and detionation phenomena, specific emissions of a CI engine.<br>
          <strong>Combustion and gasdynamics labs</strong>: Basic training to
CONVERGE software for combustion-related CFD simulations. Brief explanation to mesh
types, turbulence models, and chemistry resolution (FGM and SAGE). Discussions of notable case studies such as SANDIA Flame D with postprocessing using Tecplot 360 and
visualization of some information (velocity contour, NOx emissions, etc.). <br> <br>
<strong>Machine design project</strong>: Group project involving the design of a two-hop, three-axis parallel gearbox. Preliminary design of components in order to meet the requirements
of power, gear ratio, and stress to loads. Selection of bearings in order to withstand both
static and fatigue loads, and finally refinement of components in order to make connections
possible and make gears lighter. Software used: Solidworks, Matlab, Excel.<br> <br>
<strong>Advanced applied thermodynamics project:</strong> Group project that involved the preliminary sizing of a refrigerated compartment for food transport trucks: heat transfer analysis,
heat exchanger sizing, exergetic analysis. Software used: Excel, CoolPack.<br> <br>
<strong>Vibration mechanics laboratory:</strong> Experimental laboratory with the purpose of identifying the vibrational parameters of a cantilever beam. Data analysis and postprocessing from LVDT accelerometers using Matlab software. <br> <br>

<strong>BSc thesis project:</strong> Bachelor experimental thesis project focused on preliminary literature
research on metamaterials, design using 3D software of a mechanical metamaterial for vibration isolation: design and refinement of it in Solidworks and simulation of it through
FEM ANSYS solver, with analysis of frequency response functions (FRF inertance), transmissibility. Basic parametric study on the influence of number of holes and thickness on
dynamic behavior. In the end comparison of simulation results with those obtained from
the physical specimen during laboratory tests using an electrodynamic shaker and a signal
acquisition board as experimental apparatus, at DIMEAS of the Politecnico di Torino.
